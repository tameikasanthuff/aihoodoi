Hi guys I was wondering if any one could help out. I'm hoping to make a few sacks of produce for a viking ship scene. It's primarily as a showcase for mapping and texturing but I'd like to have the bags slumped down in accurate ways showing the fruit inside pressing against the burlap. Any ideas on the best way to generate this effect?? Thanks.

So far I've only built atmospheric rovers and flyers. Before I start, this game has a lot of promise and I'm having a lot of fun! From KSP, I learned how important center-of-gravity, center-of-mass, and center-of-thrust is.

Among the sheer danger of our current situation, the constant overpopulation of roughly every vessel in the armada is also a great cause of it, as it was not designed to transport all of us at once. Every vessel is about 1.3 times above the recommended population limit, leading to several units being forced to share already.

Since there was no megathread for all the media pieces on Cyberpunk 2077 I've decided to make my own thread. I'm gonna update it with every piece of information I'll find, all your support and help will be much appreciated. ampnbsp; I'm going to divide it into two categories: Interviews with the devs Demo impressions from behind-closed-doors previews ampnbsp; I'm gonna skip all the other articles since they are usually based on the sources mentioned above. ampnbsp; First (https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/7w1k35/external_threat/) Previous (https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/8ih3ow/external_threat_part_19/) Adrian nodded, willing Illustrator to continue.

The US Navy operates a destroyer class, frigate class, and a cruiser class for its surface complement. Recently, we have gained permission to use highly efficient and safe fusion reactors from Columbia. Normally, these reactors would be added to the Patrick Henry , Battle , and Chesapeake class as a Flight III upgrade. However, the Navy finds itself in a position where it would be easier to make a new subclass to differentiate between the nuclear-powered vessels of the conventionally powered.
